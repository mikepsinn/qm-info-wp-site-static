<p class="has-text-align-left">As any obnoxious college graduate will tell you, correlation does not necessarily imply causation. <br><br>Just because you took a drug and got better, it doesn’t mean that’s really why your symptoms went away. Even in randomized controlled trials hundreds of other things are changing in your life and diet.  <br><br>So, our FDAi must apply Hill’s 6 Criteria for Causality to infer if something causes a symptom to worsen or improve instead of just seeing what correlates with the change.</p>
