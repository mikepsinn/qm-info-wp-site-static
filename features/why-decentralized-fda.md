# Why We Need a Decentralized FDA

It takes over 10 years and $2.6 billion to bring a drug to market (including failed attempts). It costs $41k per subject in Phase III clinical trials.

The high costs lead to:

1. **No Data on Unpatentable Molecules**
   - We still know next to nothing about the long-term effects of 99.9% of the 4 pounds of over 7,000 different synthetic or natural compounds. This is because there's only sufficient incentive to research patentable molecules.
2. **Lack of Incentive to Discover Every Application of Off-Patent Treatments**
   - Most of the known diseases (approximately 95%) are classified as rare diseases. There isn't a financial incentive to get drugs approved for different conditions after the patent expires.
3. **No Long-Term Outcome Data**
   - It's not financially feasible to collect a participant's data for years or decades. Thus, we don't know if the long-term effects of a drug are worse than the initial benefits.
4. **Negative Results Aren't Published**
   - Pharmaceutical companies tend to only report "positive" results, leading to wasted money repeating research on the same dead ends.
5. **Trials Exclude a Vast Majority of The Population**
   - Only 14.5% of patients with major depressive disorder fulfilled eligibility requirements for enrollment in an antidepressant trial. Most patient sample sizes are very small.
6. **We Only Know 0.000000002% of What is Left to be Researched**
   - The more research studies we read, the more we realize we don't know. Nearly every study ends with the phrase "more research is needed".

If you multiply the 166 billion molecules with drug-like properties by the 10,000 known diseases, that's 1,162,000,000,000,000 combinations. So far, we've studied 21,000 compounds. That means we only know 0.000000002% of the effects left to be discovered.
