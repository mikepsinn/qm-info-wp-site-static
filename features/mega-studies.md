# Mega Studies

90,000 anonymously aggregated analyses on the effects of various treatments and food ingredients on symptom severity.

We publish our anonymously aggregated analyses at [the Journal of Citizen Science](https://studies.crowdsourcingcures.org/). So far, we’ve collected over 10 million data points on symptom severity and influencing factors from over 10,000 people. This data has been used to publish 90,000 studies on the effects of various treatments and food ingredients on symptom severity.

## Mega Studies

Mega studies can be focused on either:
- an outcome of interest, such as the severity of a disease or
- a predictor such as a food or a drug

### Outcome Mega Studies
Outcome Mega Studies summarize all available analyses to determine the factors most likely to improve or exacerbate a symptom of chronic illness.

### Predictor Mega Studies
Predictor Mega Studies summarize all available analyses to determine the most likely positive or negative effects of a given factor, such as a food or a drug.

## Data Sources

1. Individual Micro-Level Data – Manually entered or imported from devices/apps, shopping receipts, insurance claim data.
2. Macro-Level Epidemiological Data – Disease incidence over time, policy changes, and natural experiments.
3. Clinical Trial Data – The gold standard, but expensive and limited in scope.

### Causal Network Graphs
Network graphs indicate the likely predictive strength of the effect of various factors on an outcome. Clicking the link between two nodes will take one to a more detailed analysis of the relationship.

### Causal Flow Charts
Sankey charts indicate the likely predictive strength of the effect of various factors on an outcome in terms of the width of the link. Clicking the link between two nodes will take one to a more detailed analysis of the relationship.

### Intuition-Based Likely Cause Survey Results
Individuals may provide their own intuitive reports as to the most likely factors exacerbating their symptoms.

### Predictor Search
The Predictor Search allows one to search for the likely effects of a specific factor on the current outcome.
