# Predictor Search Engine

Optimize any quantifiable aspect of health by searching and seeing a list of the products that are most effective at helping the average user.

Aggregated user data is used to determine the factors that influence any given aspect of health the most, powering the QM Search Engine.

Anyone wanting to optimize any quantifiable aspect of their life is able to search and see a list of the products that are most effective at helping the average user achieve a particular health and wellness goal. For instance, if one wishes to improve one’s sleep efficiency, you can search for “sleep efficiency”, where one is able to select from the list of products that affect sleep efficiency the most.

#### Impact

Clinicians and those suffering from chronic conditions will have access to the personalized effectiveness rates of treatments and the likelihood of root causes, including a variety of layout settings.
